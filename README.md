# Hi, I'm Cris Motinha

Since I started programming 5 years ago, I've used my GitHub account to version all sort of code: my personal studies, college assignments (I have a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems from [the Fluminense Federal University](http://www.uff.br/)) and even birthday gifts. Here's a summary so you can browse easily through my repositories :)

### College assignments
Unfortunally, most of these projects doesn't have a readme file, if you want to know more [email me](#contact-info) or open an issue :)

- **Express.js**
These group projects were made in short time and we weren't graded by code quality: they were deployed in Heroku and every functionality worked :sweat_smile:

### Personal projects

#### My personal website
It's still in progress, but you can already see what's deployed in https://crismotinha.dev 
- https://github.com/crismotinha/crismotinha.github.io (static files)
- https://github.com/crismotinha/crismotinha.dev (made with Hugo)

#### My first portfolio page
Definety not updated but so many good memories.. :blush: It's still online [here](https://crismotinha.dev/my-portfolio/ "here")
- https://github.com/crismotinha/my-portfolio

### Personal studies
These repositories are from 2016/17, when I was still in the beggining of learning how to code. I hope listing them here will inspire me to have some new code in 2021 :)

#### Mongo DB World 17 Python crawler 
I made this Python crawler so I could see my own position in the contest MongoDB made to win hotel and travel tickets (spoiler: I got the second place :( but I went to the conference anyway!). You can see some of this story in [my medium](https://medium.com/@crismotinha/fazendo-um-crawler-em-python-para-montar-um-ranking-de-concurso-f894a897152d) and in [this interview](https://www.tecmundo.com.br/programacao/116096-cris-motinha-brasileira-escolhida-inovadora-mongodb-eua.htm) (both in Portuguese).

#### My first game
I had only 2 months of programming in HTML/CSS/JavaScript when I made it. I'm still pretty proud of it, and you can play it [here](https://crismotinha.dev/Fight-pay-or-run/)
- https://github.com/crismotinha/Fight-pay-or-run

#### Coding assignments from online courses
- Coding assignments from [HTML, CSS and Javascript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers)
	- https://crismotinha.dev/coursera-test/

- Javascript + MongoDB quick studies from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
	- https://github.com/crismotinha/timestamp-api
	- https://github.com/crismotinha/requestheaderparser-api
	- https://github.com/crismotinha/urlshortener-api

#### Some cool slides
Some cool slides used in my talk "Enquanto Houver Café, Haverá Esperança", in RioDevDay/16

### But what about the rest of the repositories?
Well, as a good programmer, I have tons of unfinished projects, repository forks that I never really worked on (or just made some tiny changes), a few too-personal-to-indexing repositories and some courses/college group assignments that in the end, weren't versioned :sob: (but at least I tried).
